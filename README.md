#win

Coin game: A game of a pair of players, on the game board are placed k coins in a row, each coin has a positive value and the players know at the beginning of the game the values ​​of all the coins. In each turn the player who desires chooses a coin from one end. The win method is a static method that ensures that the player will not lose the game.


#longestSlope
For a two-dimensional array of integers a slope of the num order of length k in the array is defined to be a series of k cells, each adjacent to its predecessor, i.e., it is one of its four neighbors in the array, so the values ​​in cells constitute a descending series of integers whose difference is num.
The longestSlope method is a recursive static method that takes the array and integer and returns the length of the longest slope in the array.


#howManySorted
Given an array of size N and a maximum positive integer value. We want to place an array in the array of numbers so that the numbers are arranged in an array in no descending order.
The howManySorted method is a recursive method that accepts the size of the array and the maximum number and returns the number of options to fill the array in numbers from the range 1 to the maximum so that they are arranged in no descending order.
